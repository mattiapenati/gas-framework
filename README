     GAS Framework for image segmentation - Politecnico di Milano - 2013
================================================================================

Starting from the original version of the GAS Framework, we implemented a 
level-set based adaptive finite element algorithm for the segmentation of 
greyscale images.
The core of the project can be found in directory "examples/image_segmentation" 
while the remaining parts of the library were interested only by minor changes.

Basic requirements for compiling and running the code:
- CGAL: Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (Management of the geometry)
  > http://www.cgal.org/
- Eigen2: Library for linear algebra (Original GAS Framework library was based on 
	  Eigen2 and we experienced some compatibility problems with Eigen3 so 
	  we just kept using Eigen2)
  > http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
- CImg: Library for image processing (We used the basic structure for the 
	management of the images)
  > http://cimg.sourceforge.net/
- libconfig: Library for configuration file 
  > http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/
- Doxygen: For generating the documentation
  > http://www.doxygen.org
  
CImg library can be used by including the header file in the project, so 
we provide a copy of the headers of the library in the root directory "gas".

We created a directory named "build" in the root of the project and we 
suggest to perform out-of-source build by running the command
 > ccmake ..
from inside this directory to keep compilation files separated from sources.

Moreover in the build directory there are three more directories:
- img: contains the images;
- test: contains test data files;
- result: where the results are saved.

Eventually there are two scripts:
- run.sh: runs the program passing the name of the test file;
- clean.sh: removes all compilation and temporary files.

Known bug: Sometimes Red-Green-Blue refinement strategy just crashes...
